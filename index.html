    <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">Schnoot, otherwise known as
      Mr. Schnoot, has an extensive military history. He acted as the
      missile in a critical battle Operation Highjump during 1946.
      Since then he's retired to take on the role of a rubber ducky
      programmer. Despite not being a duck nor having the capability
      for flight, Mr. Schnoot bravely takes on the responsibility of
      listening to Jiyoon Kim's programming woes.
